## SCION [Nixified]

Funded by the European Commission under the [Next Generation Internet](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/) initiative

### Objective

1. Allow for one to connect through SCIONLab to join the global research network on the SCION internet architecture

### Current State

As of 2020, September 11, at revision `b97c00c524930e034f84d62c7aaba7c2519faee7` this flake is in a working state and achieving all of its objectives. However, scionlab.org no longer returns the same configuration tarball for the software, and the software now expects different configuration.
